File permissmions

7: rwx (read/write/execute)
6: rw- (read/write)
5: r-x (read/execute)
4: r-- (read)
3: -wx (write/execute)
2: -w- (write)
1: --x (execute)
0: --- (no permissions)

In simpler terms, 4 = read, 2 = write and 1 = execute. Therefore read (4) and write (2)
is 6 in the octal representation, and read (4) and execute (1) is 5.
